# RTA Peer Service Analysis
This repository stores the source data, scripts, charts, and tables related to a transit service recovery analysis conducted by CMAP staff. These data serve as supporting evidence for the policy brief: Transit ridership and service trends at the RTA service boards and peer agencies.

The analysis explores recent changes in transit ridership and service levels in northeastern Illinois. It compares the performance of the region’s public transit operators – the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Metra, and Pace – with that of their peers. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the regional transit system has faced enduring challenges. The pandemic led to abrupt shifts in travel, such as a significant reduction in ridership related to remote work. It also exacerbated longstanding issues, such as frequency, reliability, safety, and security.
